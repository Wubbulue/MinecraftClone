first of all, when creating an object and adding it to global vector, prefer emplace because it adds it straight to vector, 
rather than a copy

next, be careful with object constructer freeing graphics memory, because adding vector elements often reorders them, which will
cause issues, because to reorder, it calls object destructor

to fix this, i made it a vector of unique pointers, which insures that even if the pointers are getting copied and moved around,
the underlying objets are only actually destructed when it is time to destruct them
